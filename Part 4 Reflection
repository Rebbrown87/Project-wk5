Reflection
1. Model training, as you have to make sure that you do not overfit or underfit the model and calculations have to be on point to avoid errors and bugs.

2. I would improve it by model assessing that my model is not overfitted or underfitted to save time and ensure that the model has no bugs or miscalculations by testing the code line by line.
