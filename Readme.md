## 🚜 Case Study 1: Crop Disease Prediction

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict crop disease outbreaks in smallholder farms using satellite and sensor data to enable early intervention and reduce crop loss.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Detect early signs of disease from environmental patterns.
- Alert farmers via mobile platforms.
- Improve food security and reduce losses.

### 📊 Data Sources
- Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
- IoT sensor data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity)

### 🧪 Model
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Feature: NDVI index, temperature, humidity, soil moisture
- Evaluation: Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

### 🛠️ Deployment
- Flask API or Streamlit dashboard
- Offline-compatible alerts via SMS or edge devices

### ⚖️ Ethics
- Geographic bias mitigation
- Privacy-preserving data collection

## 🏥 Case Study 2: Patient Readmission Risk

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict 30-day hospital readmission risk to support discharge planning and reduce healthcare costs.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Identify high-risk patients
- Support clinicians with actionable insights
- Improve patient outcomes

### 📊 Data Sources
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Demographics and admission history

### 🧪 Model
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- Features: Age, length of stay, comorbidity index, prior admissions
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, precision, recall

### 🛠️ Deployment
- REST API integration with hospital EHR system
- HIPAA-compliant encryption and access control

### ⚖️ Ethics
- Patient privacy and data security
- Bias in historical healthcare data
